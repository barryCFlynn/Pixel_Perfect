# User Stories

## Methodology

The **Pixel Perfect** project follows an agile-inspired methodology, emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and iterative development. This approach has guided the project's advancement:

### Agile Project Management Using GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects serves as the central hub for project management, facilitating an organized workflow. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, enabling efficient tracking of progress. The GitHub project board provides a visual overview, ensuring transparency and effective management.

### User Stories Transformed into GitHub Issues

User stories are translated into GitHub issues to capture user-centric functionalities. These issues are linked to their respective user stories, providing easy access to criteria, tasks, and discussions. This integration streamlines development and enhances clarity throughout the project lifecycle.

## Epics 
For this project, I organized my development tasks into 8 main Epics, each grouping related user stories. Due to time constraints, not all Epics have been fully implemented in this deployment. Future updates will incorporate these remaining features into the site.

### Development Approach
Instead of following traditional sprints, I closely followed the structure and methodology outlined in the Code Institute's Boutique Ado walkthrough project. This approach guided the construction of the site, ensuring alignment with best practices and industry standards throughout development.

For detailed information, please refer to the [Link to Epics](https://github.com/barryCFlynn/Pixel_Perfect/milestones) for comprehensive insights into the project's scope and development roadmap.

# SEO Implementation
To enhance the visibility of the Pixel Perfect website on search engines, we have implemented several SEO best practices, including the use of common HTML elements, and the inclusion of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.

## HTML Best Practices
Title Tags: Each page has a unique and descriptive title tag that includes relevant keywords. This helps search engines understand the content of the page and rank it appropriately.
Meta Descriptions: Descriptive meta tags are added to each page to provide a summary of the content. These descriptions appear in search engine results and can improve click-through rates.
Header Tags: We use header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure the content on each page. Proper use of header tags helps search engines understand the hierarchy and importance of the content.
Alt Text for Images: All images have descriptive alt text to ensure that search engines can index them properly. Alt text also improves accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

## Robots.txt
The robots.txt file is used to manage and restrict the access of search engine crawlers to certain parts of the website. This helps in:

Preventing the indexing of sensitive or duplicate content.
Guiding search engines to the important sections of the site that should be indexed.

## Sitemap.xml
The sitemap.xml file provides a structured list of all pages on the website, helping search engines discover and index the content more efficiently. It includes URLs of all important pages along with metadata such as the last modification date, change frequency, and priority.

<p align="right">(<a href="#table-of-content">back to top</a>)</p>



# Design

I followed the Boutique Ado project closely as it served as an excellent example of an e-commerce site with a clean and effective design. By choosing simple colors and a white background, the products are allowed to stand out, particularly because the posters themselves are vibrant and colorful. This approach ensures that the focus remains on the products, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Color

### Primary Background Colour

 ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.it/150x40/FFFFFF/000000?text=FFFFFF)

### Secondary Background Colour

![#000000](https://placehold.it/150x40/000000/FFFFFF?text=000000)


### Contrast Grid 
For the contrast grid in the design system, I have chosen to display every color used throughout the site. This includes colors utilised in various elements such as messaging, Stripe integrations, and other components. The contrast grid ensures that all colors are tested for accessibility and visual harmony.

              secure=True
          )

2. Error in Heroku after adding Cloudinary settings

    **Bug**: NameError: name 'cloudinary' is not defined
    
    **Solution**: Ensure Cloudinary was properly imported in settings.py:

          import cloudinary
          import cloudinary.uploader
          import cloudinary.api

3. Duplicate SKU Key Error

    **Bug**: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "inventory_inventoryitem_sku_uniq".
    
    **Solution**: Ensure SKU is generated uniquely if not provided:

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if not self.sku:
                self.sku = self.generate_sku()
            super().save(*args, **kwargs)

4. SMTP Email Sending Issue

    **Bug**: SMTP.starttls() got an unexpected keyword argument 'keyfile'.

    **Solution**: Downgrade Python version to 3.10.14 in Heroku by adjusting runtime.txt.

5. Quantity Input Not Updating on Desktop

    **Bug**: Quantity not greyed out at 1 on desktop view.

    **Solution**: Change quantity-form ID to a class and update the corresponding JavaScript to use class selectors.

6. Custom 404 Error Handling

    **Bug**: 500 Error when trying to load a non-existent page.

    **Solution**: Create custom 404 handler in views.py and reference it in urls.py:

        def handler404(request, exception):
            return render(request, 'errors/404.html', status=404)

        handler404 = 'boutique_ado.views.handler404'

7. OrderLineItem AttributeError

    **Bug**: 'OrderLineItem' object has no attribute 'InventoryItem'.

    **Solution**: Correct typo in OrderLineItem model `__str__` method:

          def __str__(self):
              return f'SKU {self.inventory_item.sku} on order {self.order.order_number}'

8. Signup Email Template Issue

    **Bug**: Confirmation email subject includes [example.com] instead of the actual domain.

    **Solution**: Update email domain and display name in Django admin site settings.

9. Background Image Clipping

    **Bug**: Background image being clipped by the navigation bar.

    **Solution**: Create 3 background images for different screen sizes.

10. URL-Encoding Issue with Franchise Names

    **Bug**: Navigation menu links for franchises containing spaces (e.g., "Half Life") caused syntax 
    issues in the W3C validator due to illegal characters in URLs.

    **Solution**: Template: 
    - URL-encode franchise names using the urlencode filter

          "{% url 'inventoryitems' %}?franchise={{ 'Half Life'|urlencode }}"

    - Decode the URL-encoded franchise names

          from urllib.parse import unquote
          if 'franchise' in request.GET:
          franchises = request.GET['franchise'].split(',')
          franchises = [unquote(f) for f in franchises]
          inventoryitems = inventoryitems.filter(franchise__friendly_name__in=franchises)
          franchises = Franchise.objects.filter(friendly_name__in=franchises)

11. No Image Placeholder Not Showing

    **Bug**: noimage.png was still referenceing retired location MEDIA_URL

    **Solution**: Update all refrences to noimage.png to {% static 'img/noimage.png' %}

# Deployment

### App Deployment
For deploying Your app, Heroku is used. Follow these steps:

 **Create a New App:** Create a new app on Heroku dashboard.

 **Configure Settings:**
   - Navigate to "Settings" in new app.

 **Config Vars Setup:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `PORT` as the key and `8000` as its value.

 **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Choose PostgreSQL as database.

        Example "ElephantSQL" was used in this project

 **Configure DATABASE_URL:**
   - In "Config Vars," add `DATABASE_URL` and copy the URL from PostgreSQL dashboard.

     Note: If using ElephantSQL as PostgreSQL provider, you can use the URL provided by ElephantSQL.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - Create a new file in workspace called `env.py`.
   - Import the `os` library and set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` to the Heroku address (or ElephantSQL URL)
   - Add a secret key using `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - Add the secret key to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `settings.py` of Django app, import `Path` from `pathlib`, `os`, and `dj_database_url`.
   - Add `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env` to the file.
   - Replace the SECRET_KEY with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
   - Replace the database section with `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

 **Migrate Models:**
   - In workspace terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.

### Cloudinary
To integrate Cloudinary into project, follow these steps:

 **Cloudinary Account:**
   - Log in to Cloudinary account or create one.

 **Copy CLOUDINARY_URL:**
   - Copy `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

 **Environment Variable Setup:**
   - In `env.py`, add `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "add cloudinary_url here"`.

 **Heroku Config Vars:**
   - In Heroku settings, add `CLOUDINARY_URL` to config vars.

 **Django Settings:**
   - In `INSTALLED_APPS`, add `cloudinary_storage`, `Django.contrib.staticfiles`, and `cloudinary` in this order.
   - Configure static file settings in `settings.py`: URL, storage path, directory path, root path, media URL, and default file storage.

 **Templates Directory Link:**
   - Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku with `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`.

 **Change Templates Directory:**
   - Change the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`.

 **Additional Folders:**
   - Create three new folders: `media`, `static`, and `templates`.

 **Procfile Creation:**
   - Create a `Procfile`.
   - Add the following line inside the Procfile: `web: gunicorn project_name_here.wsgi`.

 **Push Changes:**
    - Push all changes to GitHub.

 **Manual Deployment:**
    - In the Heroku deployment tab, deploy to Heroku manually the first time and closely monitor the process.
    - Once successful, set up automatic deployments.

### Version Control
To manage version control and push code to the main repository on GitHub using GitPod, follow these steps:

 **Add Changes:**
   - In the GitPod terminal, use the command `git add .` to stage changes.

 **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit changes with a descriptive comment using the command:
     ```
     git commit -m "Push comment here"
     ```

 **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the updates to the repository on GitHub with the command:
     ```
     git push
     ```

 **Migrate Models:**
    - In the terminal, migrate the models to the new database connection.
